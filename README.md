# The Python LLFUSE Module #

LLFUSE is a set of Python bindings for the low level [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) API. It requires at least FUSE 2.8.0 and supports both Python 2.x and 3.x.

LLFUSE was originally part of [S3QL](https://bitbucket.org/nikratio/s3ql/), but has been factored out so that it can be used by other projects as well.

LLFUSE is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/llfuse/). The documentation can be [read online](http://pythonhosted.org/llfuse/) and is also included in the *doc/html* directory of the LLFUSE tarball.

Please report any bugs on the [issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/nikratio/python-llfuse/issues). For discussion and questions, please use the [general FUSE mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-devel). A searchable [mailing list archive](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.fuse.devel) is kindly provided by [Gmane](http://www.gmane.org).
